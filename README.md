Messaging via Image

## Motivation
- Data communication where LAN cable can not reach.
- Injecting some useful data in image.
- Sending image via video signal (i.e. HDMI).
- Capturing video signal and decode.

- For the robustness, all data is encoded to binary pattern to avoid unexpected data change due to video gamma.
